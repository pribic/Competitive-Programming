 * 
 * observation 1 : if we have an array with odd sum, then we can't split it into 2 array of equal sum
 *                 if we take all even numbers and odd number of odd num, then total sum is odd
 *                 if we take all odd numbers then we need to take only odd cnt of odd numbers so that sum is odd
 *                 
 * observation 2 : if array has 10 20 26 such that total sum of array - 122 - by 2 - 61 - there exist a number >= this
